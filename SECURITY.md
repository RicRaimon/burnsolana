====================================

1. Scope
This policy covers the Burn program on Solana (program id: burnKNMLEUJ7ENqn3ASwSAKaxdwz7bXq9cDVhM72iDa)
and all official Burn frontends and backend services operated by the team.

2. How to report
Please report vulnerabilities privately to burnsolana@gmail.com or via Discord https://discord.gg/zDgT74N2Y.
Include a clear description of the issue, potential impact, and, if possible, a proof of concept.

3. Rules for testing
- Do not perform denial-of-service or spam attacks.
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that does not belong to you.
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before we have had a reasonable time to fix it.

4. Our commitments
- We will acknowledge your report within 5–7 business days.
- We will keep you updated about the status of the fix.
- We will not initiate legal action against good-faith researchers who follow this policy
  and applicable laws.

5. Rewards
We do not currently offer a formal bug bounty program.
However, we highly value responsible disclosure and may offer $BURN tokens as a reward.

7. Out of scope
- Informational findings without a clear security impact.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services not operated by the Burn team.
- Attacks that rely on compromised user devices, wallets, or seed phrases.

Thank you for helping keep Burn users safe.
